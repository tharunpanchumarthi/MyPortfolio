                <h2>ITO/Cloud Platforms - Western Union Cloud Delivery - Hybrid Cloud</h2>
                <p>With extensive experience in cloud technologies and IT operations, I am proficient in ITIL practices for Incident, Change, and Problem Management. I have worked on creating cloud-based infrastructures tailored to business requirements, adhering to organizational frameworks, and ensuring security within secure Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs). I am skilled in developing and maintaining scripts for provisioning and de-provisioning cloud instances as needed for workloads and managing security compliance, including password and key rotation policies. I have a strong background in handling audit and compliance activities and creating alerts to monitor system health, ensuring issues are reported to SysOps teams or escalated appropriately. Cost optimization is a key focus in my role, where I manage the full cloud lifecycle—from provisioning and automation to security—while ensuring that resources are efficiently utilized and optimized. I have experience in migrating on-premises applications to the cloud, performing cloud platform upgrades, and automating cloud/server tasks using scripts. By utilizing tools like CloudWatch, I monitor cloud resource utilization and performance, manage on-premise backups via cloud services, and deploy automation infrastructure with CloudFormation. I also work on optimizing resources, resource tagging for cost-sharing, and managing VPCs and Bastion hosts, coordinating with network teams to finalize cloud VPC connections. My responsibilities extend to managing disaster recovery, backups, and ensuring data integrity and access control within AWS, as well as capacity planning for cloud components through effective monitoring tools.</p>

                <p>The project focuses on designing and developing an Online Doctor Appointment System aimed at streamlining the doctor-patient interaction. This system enables patients to easily book appointments with doctors and track their medical progress, while also assisting doctors in managing their schedules and patient data. The front end is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the back end is powered by PHP and MySQL for database management. The development environment is set up using XAMPP server software.</p>

                <h2>Summary on Analyzing customer behavior project</h2>
                <p>Best Buy Company is one of the e-commerce industries which specializes in marketing electronic devices. As a scrum team representing Best Buy company, we were given a project to analyze our customer behavior. This project is mainly focused on predicting our customer behavior. To understand the factors influencing our customer satisfaction levels and the membership type of our customers.
                    Our project objective is to deliver a valuable product to our stakeholders inclining towards the product vision and goals. The framework we chose for implementing this project is scrum methodology. We followed all the scrum events involving sprint planning, daily scrum, sprint review and sprint retrospective. Final increments were achieved by implementing the product backlog items and sprint backlog items.
                    The tools we used for implementing the increments are Jupyter Notebook to run python simulations. Tableau, to create a dashboard visualizing customer satisfaction levels and their membership distribution. Microsoft power point to prepare presentation for sprint review. We will be establishing a total of two shippable increments. We have one product vision and six sprint goals.
                    The potential stakeholders involved in the project would be customers, company employees, our business partners, investors, and suppliers.</p>
